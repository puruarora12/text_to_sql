        "(1) The SQL must be read-only (CTEs and SELECT only; no DDL/DML), "
        "(2) Use exact table/column names from snippets; prefer fully-qualified schema.table when a schema is given, "
        "(3) Include appropriate JOINs, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY as needed, "
        "(4) If the user did not specify a limit, append LIMIT 100, "

        "- If multiple tables look similar, choose the one with columns most aligned to the request.\n"
